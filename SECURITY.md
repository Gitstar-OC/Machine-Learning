## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Introduction**

We take the security and integrity of our GitHub repository very seriously. If you believe you've found a vulnerability or security issue in our code, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us. This document outlines our policy for receiving and responding to vulnerability reports.

**Reporting a Vulnerability**

If you've discovered a potential security vulnerability in our repository, please report it to us immediately. We consider security vulnerabilities to be a top priority and will respond promptly to your report.

**How to Report a Vulnerability**

To report a vulnerability, please email us at chandankarom07@gmail.com or message at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/om-chandankar/). When submitting a report, please include as much detail as possible, such as:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant code snippets or examples
- Your suggested fix, if applicable

**Fixing the Vulnerability**

If you're able to provide a fix for the vulnerability, we encourage you to do so. You can create a pull request with your proposed fix, and we'll review it as soon as possible.

**Security Alerts**

If you've identified a security alert or vulnerability, please create an issue in our repository rather than a pull request. This allows us to track and respond to the issue more effectively.

**Response Policy**

We will respond to all vulnerability reports within [insert timeframe, e.g., 24 hours] and will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the issue. We will not disclose your identity or the details of your report without your permission, unless required by law.

**Responsible Disclosure**

We ask that you practice responsible disclosure when reporting vulnerabilities. This means:
- Not disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it
- Not using the vulnerability to access or modify data without permission
- Not using the vulnerability to disrupt our service or systems

**Acknowledgement**

We appreciate your help in keeping our repository secure. If you report a vulnerability, we'll acknowledge your contribution and may even recognize you in our release notes or security acknowledgements, if you wish.

Thank you for your help in keeping our repository secure.
