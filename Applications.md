# Application of Machine Learning

## Why is machine learning so widely used today? 
Machine Learning had grown up as a sub-field of AI or artificial intelligence. We wanted to build intelligent machines. It turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from a to b, like in your GPS. But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car. The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. 

Machine learning skills have the potential to be applied to a wide range of industries, with the likelihood of impacting almost every sector in the near future. The ultimate goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or creating machines with intelligence comparable to humans, is still far from being achieved. However, the pursuit of AGI is driven by the development of learning algorithms, some of which may be inspired by the human brain.

The potential value of AI and machine learning is immense, with a McKinsey study estimating an additional 13 trillion US dollars of annual value by 2030. While the software industry has already benefited greatly from machine learning, there are vast opportunities for value creation in other sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, and materials manufacturing.

The high demand for machine learning skills across various sectors makes this an opportune time to learn and master these skills. The knowledge gained in machine learning can lead to exciting applications and contribute to significant advancements in technology and industry.
