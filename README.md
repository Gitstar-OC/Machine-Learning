# Machine-Learning-Specialization 
- ### This course is beginner friendly along with some tough challenges for intermidiate engineers in machines. Don't worry if you dont know python! Just give this course a try üòÑüëç. 
- ### This are my machine learning notes I have created in my learning journey of AI and Machine, This will surely help beginners and intermidiate people to learn and understand machine learning. Feel free to clone, and fork üç¥.
- ### I also have occasionally added questions like taught in classes  to help make sure you understand the content like this üôÇ
**Question:**
Description of question 
- Option A 
- Option B
>  Answer: Solution will be given here, with some explaination in below lines


>  `B` for Beginner and `I` for intermediate level
