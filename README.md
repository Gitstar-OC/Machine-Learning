# Machine-Learning-Specialization ( In Progress...)
- ### This course is beginner friendly along with some tough challenges for intermidiate engineers in machines. Don't worry if you dont know python! Just give this course a try üòÑüëç. 
- ### This are my machine learning notes I have created in my learning journey of AI and Machine, This will surely help beginners and intermidiate people to learn and understand machine learning. Feel free to clone, and fork üç¥.
- ### I also have occasionally added questions like taught in classes  to help make sure you understand the content like this üôÇ
**Question:**
Description of question 
- Option A 
- Option B
>  Answer: Solution will be given here, with some explaination in below lines


>  `B` for Beginner, `I` for intermediate level and `A` for Advanced!!


### Start with the basics
- `B` [Overview of Machine Learning](Basics/Overview.md)

- `B` [Unsupervised Machine Learning Part 2](Unsupervised%20Learning/UnsupervisedLearning2.md)

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Jupyter notebook is a type of `IDE` in machine learning which provides to many options to the developers to create and run the code. Check the below file to get started! 
> **Note:** You should first clone the project and open it in your IDE or in jupyter notebook to understand it in depth. 
### [Jupyter Notebook](Jupyter%20Notebooks/JupyterNotebook.md)
