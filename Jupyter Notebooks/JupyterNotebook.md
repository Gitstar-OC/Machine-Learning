# What are [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)?

- The most widely used tool by machine learning and data science practitioners today is the Jupyter Notebook. This is the default environments that a lot of us use to code up and experiment and try things out.

From the notes, you've seen supervised learning and unsupervised learning and also examples of both. For you to more deeply understand these concepts, I'll like to invite you to see, learn and maybe later write codes yourself to implement these concepts. 

In this section, right here in your web browser, you build a user Jupyter Notebook environment to test out some of these ideas for yourself as well. This is not some made up simplified environment, this is the exact same environments, the exact same tool, the Jupyter Notebook that developers are using in many large countries right now. 

By reading through and running the code in the optional labs, you see how machine learning code runs. You should complete them relatively quickly just by running it one line at a time from top to bottom.

Let's take a look at an example of a notebook. [Click Here](Jupyter%20Notebooks/IntroductiontoJupyterNotebook.ipynb) to open the jupyter notebook. Feel free to scroll up and down and browse and mouseover the different menus and take a look at the different options here.<u> You might notice that there are two types of these blocks</u>, also called `cells` in the notebook and there are <u>two types of cells</u>. One is what's called a `Markdown cell`, <u> which means a bunch of tax, but this is text that describes the code</u> . Then there's a second type of block or cell which looks like this, which has a `code cell`. Here, if want to run this code cell, hitting `Shift Enter` will run the code in this code cell.
