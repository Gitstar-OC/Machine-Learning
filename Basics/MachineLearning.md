# What is machine learning?
Here's a definition of what is machine learning that is attributed to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as `the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.` Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing program. The amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. By watching what social support positions tend to lead to wins and what positions tend to lead to losses the checkers plane program learned over time what are good or bad suport positions by trying to get a good and avoid bad positions, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself. It was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than also, Samuel himself.

**Question:**
If Arthur Samuel's checkers-playing program had been allowed to play only 10 games against itself, how would this have affected its performance compared to when it was allowed to play over 10,000 games?

- Would have made it worse
- Would have made it better
>  Answer: Would have made it worse

In general, the more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform. 

**The two main types of machine learning are `supervised learning` and `unsupervised learning`.**  Of these two, supervised learning is the type of machine learning that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation. By far, the most used types of learning algorithms today are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems. 

In the Machine Learning specialization, a significant emphasis is placed on providing practical advice for the application of learning algorithms. It is crucial to not only possess a comprehensive set of tools but also to have the expertise to apply them effectively. Merely having access to state-of-the-art tools does not guarantee the ability to construct a complex structure, such as a three-story house. Similarly, in the field of machine learning, it is essential to have both the tools and the knowledge to utilize them efficiently.  It is a common occurrence for even experienced machine learning teams at top tech companies to struggle with the application of machine learning algorithms to certain problems, sometimes spending six months without significant progress. Often, a different approach to using these tools could have led to a more successful outcome. This knowledge aims to prevent students from experiencing the setbacks of pursuing ineffective strategies for extended periods.


Now you got a sense of how the most skilled machine learning engineers build systems.
